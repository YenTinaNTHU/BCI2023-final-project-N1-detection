    - Analyzing the hidden independent conponent within EEG using ICA with
        1. Apply ICA to your EEG data
        2. use ICLabel to automatically label the ICs and estimate the probability of each IC being either non-brain artifactual or Brain ICs.
        3. Investigate and analyze the change in the number of recognized ICs for the
        following EEG datasets: 
            1. Raw EEG data 
            2. Filtered EEG data
            3. EEG data corrected using ASR.
